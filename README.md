# Basketball_MVPs
Simple analysis of basketball MVPs from 8 different leagues from 1955-2019

I have performed the following tasks:
- Import libraries and dataset
- Review the DF
- Extracting the top shooters
- Analysing the impact of having a much larger amount of NBA players than the rest of the league
- A few simple visualizations on:
        - League Spread
        - Scatterplot of shooting
        - Scatterplot of Defensive actions

Thank you for reading!!
